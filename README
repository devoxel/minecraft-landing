This is a small go server that acts as a landing page for a minecraft server.

* It lets you add yourself to the whitelist.
* It exposes world downloads.
* It has a little page explaining the world.

I am not going to document this, so if you want to use it, please
go ahead and figure it out yourself.

The code is licenced under MIT but I cant include the images because they are
all ripped from geocities. I might dump them in a release if I am bothered.
